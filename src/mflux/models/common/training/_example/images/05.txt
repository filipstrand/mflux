This is a charming, high-resolution studio portrait of a very young Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy, set against a vibrant, solid orange background that creates a warm and cheerful mood.

The puppy is the central focus, sitting upright and facing the camera with an endearing, slightly sleepy expression. Its most prominent features are its disproportionately large, erect ears, which are a rich tan color on the outside with soft, pinkish-white fur on the inside. The ears are wide-set and give the puppy a fox-like, alert appearance.

The puppy's coat is a classic red and white bicolor. The top of its head and the area around its eyes are a warm, reddish-brown, while a distinct white blaze runs down the center of its forehead and muzzle. The white fur extends to its chest, underbelly, and the lower parts of its front legs, which are tipped with white paws. The fur appears soft, fluffy, and well-groomed.

Its eyes are dark and expressive, with a gentle, slightly squinted gaze that adds to its sleepy charm. The puppy is captured mid-action, licking its nose with a long, pink tongue that curls up towards its black, moist nose. This playful gesture adds a dynamic and adorable element to the portrait.

The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the texture of the puppy's fur without creating harsh shadows. The composition is a tight, centered shot that fills the frame with the puppy's head and upper body, emphasizing its cute features and making it impossible to look away. The overall effect is one of pure, unadulterated cuteness, capturing a fleeting, sweet moment in the puppy's life.
