# Ideogram 4

This directory contains MFLUX's MLX implementation of **Ideogram 4 FP8**.

MFLUX supports [ideogram-ai/ideogram-4-fp8](https://huggingface.co/ideogram-ai/ideogram-4-fp8), a typography-focused text-to-image model distributed in an FP8 weight layout. The checkpoint expects structured **JSON captions** for best results; plain text prompts are accepted but often underperform.

**Supported in mflux:** text-to-image generation, JSON-caption validation, sampler presets, quantization via `mflux-save`, LoRA loading via `--lora-paths` (community formats; not yet validated against published Ideogram LoRAs), and shared CLI callbacks (stepwise previews, memory saver).

**Not supported yet:** image-to-image, training, Ideogram's hosted [Magic Prompt](https://github.com/ideogram-oss/ideogram-4/blob/main/docs/prompting.md#magic-prompt) API, and non-FP8 checkpoint layouts.

The collage above uses JSON captions for four themes: **natural-history poster**, **lifestyle photography**, **hand-sketched product label**, and **typographic event poster**. Ideogram 4 is strongest with structured captions like these rather than plain prompts.

For the caption schema, key-order rules, bounding-box layout, and color palette conditioning, see Ideogram's official [prompting guide](https://github.com/ideogram-oss/ideogram-4/blob/main/docs/prompting.md) and [Ideogram 4.0 technical blog](https://ideogram.ai/blog/ideogram-4.0/) (gallery images include full JSON prompts). To expand plain text into JSON captions, Ideogram provides [Magic Prompt](https://github.com/ideogram-oss/ideogram-4/blob/main/docs/prompting.md#magic-prompt); mflux does not call the hosted API; use `--prompt-file` or write JSON captions yourself.

## Example

The following uses the default `V4_DEFAULT_20` preset (20 steps with a guidance schedule):

```sh
mflux-generate-ideogram4 \
  --prompt-file teapot-caption.json \
  --width 1024 \
  --height 1024 \
  --seed 42 \
  --preset V4_DEFAULT_20
```

Example caption file:

```json
{
  "high_level_description": "A white ceramic teapot on a simple studio table.",
  "style_description": {
    "aesthetics": "clean, calm, minimal",
    "lighting": "soft diffuse studio lighting",
    "photo": "eye-level, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field",
    "medium": "photograph",
    "color_palette": ["#FFFFFF", "#E5E0D8", "#2E2E2E"]
  },
  "compositional_deconstruction": {
    "background": "A neutral studio tabletop with a pale wall behind it.",
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "obj",
        "bbox": [250, 320, 780, 690],
        "desc": "A glossy white ceramic teapot with a curved handle and short spout."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Presets

| Preset | Steps | Notes |
|--------|------:|-------|
| `V4_DEFAULT_20` | 20 | Default; balanced quality and speed |
| `V4_QUALITY_48` | 48 | Higher quality, slower |
| `V4_TURBO_12` | 12 | Faster, slightly different schedule |

Each preset sets the step count, per-step guidance schedule, and noise schedule. Shared `--steps` and `--guidance` flags are ignored on this CLI.

> Ideogram 4 requires downloading gated model weights from Hugging Face (~28 GB on disk for the FP8 checkpoint). Access must be approved on the model card before the first download.

## Notes

- Width and height must be in `[256, 2048]` and multiples of 16.
- JSON captions are compacted with `ensure_ascii=False` before tokenization. Validation follows the schema described in Ideogram's [prompting guide](https://github.com/ideogram-oss/ideogram-4/blob/main/docs/prompting.md).
- Caption validation warns for plain prompts, malformed JSON, schema issues, key-order problems, invalid bounding boxes, and non-uppercase hex colors. Use `--strict-caption-validation` to fail on warnings.
- Plain text prompts still run, but they can reduce quality and increase safety-filter false positives.
- The VAE is shared with FLUX.2 Klein; the FP8 linear stack, Qwen3-VL text encoder, and dual transformers live under `models/ideogram4/` (not shared with FLUX.2 yet).
