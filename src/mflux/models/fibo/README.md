# FIBO
[FIBO](https://huggingface.co/briaai/FIBO) from [Bria.ai](https://bria.ai), the first open-source JSON-native text-to-image model trained on long structured captions. FIBO delivers high image quality, strong prompt adherence, and professional-grade control—trained exclusively on licensed data. ([Technical Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06876))

![FIBO Example](../../assets/fibo_example.jpg)

FIBO is an 8B-parameter DiT-based, flow-matching model using **SmolLM3-3B** as the text encoder with a novel **DimFusion** conditioning architecture for efficient long-caption training, and **Wan 2.2** as the VAE. The VLM-assisted prompting uses a fine-tuned **Qwen3-VL** to expand short user intents, fill in missing details, and extract/edit structured prompts from images.

Most text-to-image models excel at imagination—but not control. FIBO is trained on structured JSON captions up to 1,000+ words, enabling precise, reproducible control over lighting, composition, color, and camera settings. The structured captions foster native disentanglement, allowing targeted, iterative refinement without prompt drift.

## Key Features
- **VLM-guided JSON-native prompting**: Transform short prompts into structured schemas with 1,000+ words (lighting, camera, composition, DoF)
- **Disentangled control**: Tweak a single attribute (e.g., camera angle) without breaking the scene
- **Strong prompt adherence**: High alignment on PRISM-style evaluations
- **Enterprise-grade**: 100% licensed data with governance, repeatability, and legal clarity

## FIBO Lite

[FIBO Lite](https://huggingface.co/briaai/Fibo-lite) is a two-stage distilled variant combining CFG distillation and SCFM for fast few-step generation. Use `--model fibo-lite` for ~10x speed: 8 steps, `guidance=1.0`, no negative prompt needed. Slight quality tradeoff vs. base FIBO.

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo \
  --model fibo-lite \
  --prompt "A tiny watercolor robot in a garden" \
  --steps 8 \
  --seed 42
```

<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from mflux.models.common.config import ModelConfig
from mflux.models.fibo.variants.txt2img.fibo import FIBO
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.fibo_vlm import FiboVLM

vlm = FiboVLM()
json_prompt = vlm.generate(prompt="A tiny watercolor robot in a garden", seed=42)
model = FIBO(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo_lite())

    num_inference_steps=8,
)
image.save("robot_lite.png")
```
</details>

## The four modes: Generate, Edit, Refine, and Inspire

### Generate
While the actual prompt input to FIBO is a structured JSON file, the generate command provides an interface to input pure text prompts. These are then expanded into structured JSON prompts using FIBO's Vision-Language Model (VLM) before being passed to the diffusion model for image generation.

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo \
  --prompt "Three cartoon animal chefs in a colorful bakery kitchen, Pixar style: a bunny with floppy ears wearing a tall white chef hat and pink apron holding a chocolate cake on the left, a raccoon with a striped tail wearing blue oven mitts and a yellow bandana frosting cupcakes in the center, a penguin wearing a red bowtie and checkered apron carrying a tray of golden croissants on the right, warm kitchen lighting with flour dust in air" \
  --width 1200 \
  --height 540 \
  --steps 20 \
  --guidance 4.0 \
  --seed 42 \
  --output animal_bakers.png
```

<details>
<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mflux.models.common.config import ModelConfig
from mflux.models.fibo.variants.txt2img.fibo import FIBO
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.fibo_vlm import FiboVLM
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

vlm = FiboVLM()
json_prompt = vlm.generate(
    prompt="Three cartoon animal chefs in a colorful bakery kitchen, Pixar style: a bunny with floppy ears wearing a tall white chef hat and pink apron holding a chocolate cake on the left, a raccoon with a striped tail wearing blue oven mitts and a yellow bandana frosting cupcakes in the center, a penguin wearing a red bowtie and checkered apron carrying a tray of golden croissants on the right, warm kitchen lighting with flour dust in air",
    seed=42,
)
FiboVLMUtil.save_json_prompt(Path("animal_bakers.json"), json_prompt)

model = FIBO(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo())
image = model.generate_image(
    seed=42,
    prompt=json_prompt,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    width=1200,
    height=540,
    guidance=4.0,
)
image.save("animal_bakers.png")
```
</details>

This command will output both the generated image (`animal_bakers.png`) and a JSON prompt file (`animal_bakers.json`) containing the expanded structured prompt used for generation.

If a JSON prompt file is provided, it will be used directly for image generation, thus bypassing the VLM step and giving you full control over the prompt structure:

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo \
    --prompt-file animal_bakers.json \
    --width 1200 \
    --height 540 \
    --steps 50 \
    --guidance 4.0 \
    --seed 42 \
    --output animal_bakers.png
```

from mflux.models.fibo.variants.txt2img.fibo import FIBO
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

structured_prompt = FiboVLMUtil.get_structured_prompt(Path("animal_bakers.json"))
model = FIBO(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo())
image = model.generate_image(
    seed=42,
    prompt=structured_prompt,

    width=1200,
    height=540,
    guidance=4.0,
)
image.save("animal_bakers.png")
```
</details>

When working with a JSON prompt file, you can use whatever tool you prefer to edit it and are not forced to use the built-in FIBO-VLM. Other good alternatives are [coding](https://cursor.com/agents) [agents](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), other [LLMs](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm)/[VLMs](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) etc.

Note: This JSON prompt was generated using FIBO's "Generate" mode from a short text description. Note the strong alignment between the JSON prompt and the image!
</details>

### Refine
While the JSON prompt can be edited manually, it can be quite complex and inconvenient to modify directly. The refinement mode expands a simple user instruction in order to tweak specific attributes. The VLM processes these instructions and updates the JSON prompt accordingly before generating new images.

![FIBO Refine Example](../../assets/fibo_refine_example.jpg)

Assuming we already have a previous prompt file, like `owl_brown.json`, we can refine this prompt to change the owl's color and add some accessories:

```sh
mflux-refine-fibo \
    --prompt-file owl_brown.json \
    --instructions "Make the owl white instead of brown, and add round glasses and a black scarf. Keep everything else exactly the same - the same forest background, moonlight lighting, composition, and overall whimsical atmosphere." \
    --output owl_white.json
```

<details>
<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.fibo_vlm import FiboVLM
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

vlm = FiboVLM()
refined_json = vlm.refine(
    seed=42,
    structured_prompt=FiboVLMUtil.get_structured_prompt(Path("owl_brown.json")),
    editing_instructions="Make the owl white instead of brown, and add round glasses and a black scarf. Keep everything else exactly the same - the same forest background, moonlight lighting, composition, and overall whimsical atmosphere.",
)
FiboVLMUtil.save_json_prompt(Path("owl_white.json"), refined_json)
```
</details>

Then generate the refined image using the updated JSON prompt:

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo \
    --prompt-file owl_white.json \
    --width 1024 \
    --height 560 \
    --steps 20 \
    --guidance 4.0 \
    --seed 42 \
    --quantize 4 \
    --output owl_white.png
```

<details>
<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mflux.models.common.config import ModelConfig
from mflux.models.fibo.variants.txt2img.fibo import FIBO
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

structured_prompt = FiboVLMUtil.get_structured_prompt(Path("owl_white.json"))
model = FIBO(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo(), quantize=4)
image = model.generate_image(
    seed=42,
    prompt=structured_prompt,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    width=1024,
    height=560,
    guidance=4.0,
)
image.save("owl_white.png")
```
</details>

It is worth noting that refine does not work the same way as other editing techniques like Flux Kontext or Qwen Image Edit. Instead of modifying an existing image, it modifies the underlying **structured prompt** to produce a new image.

### Inspire
Provide an image instead of text. FIBO's vision-language model extracts a detailed, structured prompt, blends it with your creative intent, and produces related images—ideal for inspiration without overreliance on the original.

![FIBO Inspire Example](../../assets/fibo_inspire_example.jpg)

Starting from an image, you can extract a structured JSON prompt that captures its visual characteristics:

```sh
mflux-inspire-fibo \
    --image-path bird.jpg \
    --prompt "blue and brown bird on brown tree trunk" \
    --output bird_inspired.json \
    --seed 42
```

<details>
<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.fibo_vlm import FiboVLM
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

vlm = FiboVLM()
image = FiboVLMUtil.load_image(Path("bird.jpg"))
inspired_json = vlm.inspire(
    seed=42,
    image=image,
    prompt="blue and brown bird on brown tree trunk",
)
FiboVLMUtil.save_json_prompt(Path("bird_inspired.json"), inspired_json)
```
</details>

Then generate new images with similar characteristics:

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo \
    --prompt-file bird_inspired.json \
    --width 1024 \
    --height 672 \
    --steps 50 \
    --guidance 4.0 \
    --seed 42 \
    -q 8 \
    --output bird_inspired.png
```

structured_prompt = FiboVLMUtil.get_structured_prompt(Path("bird_inspired.json"))
model = FIBO(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo(), quantize=8)
image = model.generate_image(
    seed=42,
    prompt=structured_prompt,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    width=1024,
    height=672,
    guidance=4.0,
)
image.save("bird_inspired.png")
```
</details>

### FIBO-Edit
FIBO Edit supports direct image-conditioned editing using a plain-text edit instruction plus a source image.
The CLI will convert the instruction + image into a structured JSON prompt automatically.

![FIBO Edit Example](../../assets/fibo_edit_example.jpg)

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo-edit \
    --image-path reference_upscaled.png \
    --prompt "Make the hand fistbump the camera instead of showing a flat palm." \
    --width 640 \
    --height 384 \
    --steps 30 \
    --guidance 3.5 \
    --seed 42 \
    --output fibo_edit_fistbump.png
```

<details>
<summary>Python API</summary>

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mflux.models.common.config import ModelConfig
from mflux.models.fibo.variants.edit import FIBOEdit
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.fibo_vlm import FiboVLM
from mflux.models.fibo_vlm.model.util import FiboVLMUtil

vlm = FiboVLM(quantize=8)
structured_prompt = vlm.edit(
    image=FiboVLMUtil.load_image(Path("image.png")),
    edit_instruction="Make the hand fistbump the camera instead of showing a flat palm.",
    seed=42,
)

model = FIBOEdit(model_config=ModelConfig.fibo_edit(), quantize=8)
image = model.generate_image(
    seed=42,
    prompt=structured_prompt,
    image_path="image.png",
    num_inference_steps=30,
    width=640,
    height=384,
    guidance=3.5,
)
image.save("fibo_edit_fistbump.png")
```
</details>

Optional localized editing is supported with a mask:

![FIBO Edit Mask Example](../../assets/fibo_edit_mask_example.jpg)

```sh
mflux-generate-fibo-edit \
    --image-path reference_upscaled.png \
    --mask-path hand_mask.png \
    --prompt "Make only the masked hand fistbump the camera and keep the rest of the image unchanged." \
    --steps 30 \
    --guidance 3.5 \
    --seed 42 \
    --output fibo_edit_fistbump_masked.png
```

Advanced use: you can still pass a full structured JSON prompt via `--prompt` or `--prompt-file`.
When doing so, make sure the JSON includes `edit_instruction`.
