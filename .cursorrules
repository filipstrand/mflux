Always use `uv` for dependency management and running scripts in this project.

- Use `uv run <command>` to run scripts or binaries.
- Use `uv add <package>` and `uv remove <package>` to manage dependencies.
- Prefer `uv run python -m ...` for running local modules to ensure the correct environment and dependencies are used.
- When running tests, always use `MFLUX_PRESERVE_TEST_OUTPUT=1` to keep the test images for visual inspection.
- When making a new release, always update the version in `pyproject.toml`, update the lockfile with `uv lock`, and add a descriptive entry to `CHANGELOG.md`. Tagging is handled by an external GitHub Action when publishing the release.
