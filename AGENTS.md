# Agent notes (mflux)

Primary guidance for Cursor agents lives in:

- `.cursor/rules/RULE.md`
- `.cursor/commands/` (reusable workflows like `/test-fast`, `/lint`, `/release-prep`, `/pr`)

Compatibility note: `.cursorrules` is kept as a short, legacy-compatible summary of the same core constraints.
